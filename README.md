**Minimal binding for js**

##
A much simple and lightweight binding framework for js. It is written by me who get used to data binding of WPF.
So I try to simulate as much as posible the concept of it.

**Approaching**

##
- Using 'Proxy' to track change of model layer.
- View model inspired by Vue.js (data & method prop)
- Using simple 'jQuery' to update presentation layer.

**Roadmap**

##
- Object change tracking (shallow tracking).
- Object change tracking (deep tracking) & bubble up notification.
- Array change tracking.
- Binding expression.
- Binding 2 ways view <-> viewmodel.
- Converter ?
